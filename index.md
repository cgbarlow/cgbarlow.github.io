# Projects

## [Campaign Mode](https://chrisbarlow.nz/campaign-mode/)

**Work with a party of AI advisors with genuinely different perspectives.**

[![Campaign Mode agents gathered in a fantasy tavern](https://github.com/cgbarlow/campaign-mode/raw/main/docs/campaign-mode-agents.jpg)](https://chrisbarlow.nz/campaign-mode/)

Inspired by Dr Simon McCallum's Six Animals framework, Campaign Mode recruits six psychologically-grounded AI advisors to challenge your assumptions, surface your blind spots, and stress-test your work before it matters. Frame your work as a quest, face the Dragon, and come out with something you're genuinely proud of.

Available as a plugin for Claude Desktop and Claude Code.

## [Guild Hall](https://chrisbarlow.nz/guild-hall/)

**Quest-based engagement platform where communities complete adventures, not checklists.**

[![Guild Hall Dashboard](https://github.com/cgbarlow/guild-hall/raw/main/files/guild-hall-dashboard.png)](https://chrisbarlow.nz/guild-hall/)

Guild Hall is where Game Masters design quests for their communities, and community members actually complete them. Browse the Bounty Board, accept a quest, submit evidence, earn points, unlock badges, and progress through skill tiers from Apprentice to Legend.

Whether you run a meetup, a learning community, or a team, Guild Hall turns participation into adventure.
